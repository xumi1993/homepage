I'm a PhD student in Nanjing University, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering. My research interests include inner earth structures, Artificial Intelligence. I am working in [Zhouchuan Huang](http://es.nju.edu.cn/hzc/list.htm)'s group, which focus on:

- Earth structures of east Asia and the Tibet Plateau in Cenozoic
- P and S wave seismic anisotropy and tomography
- Subduction zones: structures, geodynamics and seismotectonics. 

Since 2013, I have been in this group to study the crustal and mantle transition zone structures in SE Tibet using Receiver Function method. I have developed *Seispy*, *SplitRFLab*, *SFT*, *BQMail* to process seismic data.
